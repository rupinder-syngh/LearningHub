## About The App

[LearningHub] To develop a centralized platform for learning, knowledge sharing and assessment. At present, when an intern joins our organization, there is no predefined learning path which he/she is going to follow. So he just explores things on his own. On our platform we are going to create profile specific courses which the individual is going to follow and once the course is completed, his assessment can be done on the same platform which can be in the form of both “MCQs” and “Live assessment sessions”.
This platform is also going to serve as a place for knowledge sharing where an individual can share his acquired knowledge/skills and each employee of our organization can view and interact through the channel of comments.
